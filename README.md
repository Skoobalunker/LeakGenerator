**Idea**

This project allows you to generate your own personal email and password leak combo. 

Fancy generating 280 milion fake emails with equally fake password? Why not ... (just run 'leakme.py')

If you **really** need to create more emails/passwords just edit the file and change 'min' and 'max' variable.

**Why?**

For fun. Need more info? read this http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/05/the-massive-password-breach-that-wasnt-google-says-data-is-98-bogus/

**Example**

See example.out file for a list of randomly generated 'leak'
